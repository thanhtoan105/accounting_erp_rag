### Checklist Items
Pass Rate: 11/11 (100%)

- [✓ PASS] Overview clearly ties to PRD goals  
  Evidence: L10-L14 describe Epic 1 as “foundation for the AI-native accounting platform… pilot expectations” aligning with PRD goals and success gates.

- [✓ PASS] Scope explicitly lists in-scope and out-of-scope  
  Evidence: L18-L33 enumerate “In Scope” bullet list and “Out of Scope” counterpart covering boundaries.

- [✓ PASS] Design lists all services/modules with responsibilities  
  Evidence: L43-L52 service table detailing components such as `rag-query-controller`, `supabase-gateway`, and ownership/responsibilities.

- [✓ PASS] Data models include entities, fields, and relationships  
  Evidence: L55-L68 table documenting entities (`vector_documents`, `embedding_batches`, etc.) with key fields and notes on relationships/partitioning.

- [✓ PASS] APIs/interfaces are specified with methods and schemas  
  Evidence: L71-L82 table outlining endpoints (`/api/v1/rag/query`, SSE stream, internal APIs) including request/response contracts.
