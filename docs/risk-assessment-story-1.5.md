## Risk Summary

### Critical Risks (Score â‰¥ 6)
1. **Vector embedding API degradation** (Score: 6) - Mitigated in Story 1.5 with circuit breaker and fallback
2. **Inconsistent embeddings** (Score: 6) - Mitigated with single model strategy
3. **Poor recall performance** (Score: 6) - To be validated in Story 1.9 with quality metrics

### High-Risk Areas (Score 4-5)
- pgvector performance at scale (4)
- Vector sync delays (4)
- Bilingual support gaps (4)
- Redis cache failures (4)

### Gate Decision: **CONCERNS**
- **Critical risks**: All have documented mitigations implemented in Story 1.5
- **Residual risks**: Performance at scale and recall quality need validation in future stories
- **Recommendation**: Proceed to Story 1.6 with monitoring triggers for scale testing

## Mitigation Implementation Status

### âœ… Complete (Story 1.5)
- Circuit breaker for embedding API with keyword search fallback
- JWT-based RBAC with @PreAuthorize enforcement
- Company_id filtering for multi-tenancy
- Redis caching with 15-minute TTL
- OpenTelemetry instrumentation and Prometheus metrics
- Bilingual embedding support with multilingual model

### ðŸ”„ In Progress (Future Stories)
- Scale testing with 100K+ vectors (Story 1.6)
- Recall@10 quality validation (Story 1.9)
- Change data capture for real-time sync (Story 1.7)

## Risk Monitoring Triggers

- **Performance**: Alert if P95 retrieval latency >1500ms for 5min
- **Quality**: Alert if recall@10 <0.85 (measured in Story 1.9)
- **Availability**: Alert if embedding API error rate >10%
- **Security**: Alert if RBAC validation failures >1% of queries
