## Story

As a platform engineer building the Core RAG foundation,
I want to configure Supabase pgvector with tuned schemas, indexes, and operational runbooks,
so that vector retrieval meets latency, compliance, and resilience targets for downstream RAG stories.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Supabase project has pgvector extension enabled and verified in staging and pilot environments. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector)]
2. `vector_documents` schema created with columns: `id`, `document_id`, `company_id`, `embedding VECTOR(1536)`, `metadata JSONB`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, plus supporting indexes for tenant isolation. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector); docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#Data Models and Contracts]
3. HNSW (or IVFFlat) index configured for cosine similarity; benchmarking across 10K, 50K, 100K documents recorded with P95 latency ≤ 1500 ms for top-10 retrieval. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector); docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC1 – Performance Baseline]
4. Metadata filtering validated for module, fiscal period, and document type fields with representative query examples documented. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector)]
5. Backup and restore approach for vector tables documented, including Supabase PITR usage and export scripts. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector); docs/solution-architecture.md#DevOps and CI/CD]
6. Connection pooling established for vector workloads via `supabase-gateway`, sharing health checks and retry logic with existing Postgres connections. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#Services and Modules]
7. Metrics for retrieval latency, index size, and recall recorded in observability dashboards with alert thresholds aligned to NFR-1 and NFR-8. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC1 – Performance Baseline; docs/solution-architecture.md#15. Testing Strategy]
8. Runbook updated to include operational steps for index rebuilds, scaling configuration, and troubleshooting slow queries. [Source: docs/epics.md#E1-S3 Vector Database Setup (Supabase Vector); docs/solution-architecture.md#DevOps and CI/CD]

## Dev Notes

- Use existing `supabase-gateway` module for all vector connectivity to keep pooling, retries, and observability consistent with transactional access. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#Services and Modules]
- Align vector schema migrations with Liquibase strategy under `apps/backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/` to preserve auditability and soft-delete handling. [Source: docs/stories/story-1.2.md#Dev Notes]
- Benchmark scripts should align with performance gates (P95 ≤ 1.5s retrieval, end-to-end ≤ 8s) and feed telemetry metrics defined in AC1/AC7. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#AC1 – Performance Baseline]

### Project Structure Notes

<!-- structure_alignment_summary
- Carry forward Story 1.2 follow-ups: embed masking hooks inside `embedding-worker`, schedule PII scanner cron, and generate masking performance benchmarks once vector pipeline is ready. [Source: docs/stories/story-1.2.md#Completion Notes List]
- Unified project structure doc not present; align schema migrations under `apps/backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/` and shared utilities within `packages/shared`, matching prior stories. [Source: docs/stories/story-1.2.md#Dev Notes]
- Ensure new vector DB artifacts live alongside existing Supabase integrations managed by `supabase-gateway` to avoid stray module paths. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#Services and Modules]
-->

- Liquibase changelog updates stay within `apps/backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/`.
- Shared vector access helpers should live in `packages/shared` if reused beyond backend services; otherwise keep within `supabase-gateway` domain modules.

### Debug Log References

**2025-10-20 - Implementation Plan Kickoff**:
- Sequence work by story checklist: AC1 infrastructure enablement → AC2 schema/DAO → AC3/AC7 benchmarking + metrics → AC4/AC5 metadata + backups → AC6/AC7/AC8 pooling & runbook polish.
- For AC1, create Liquibase change set to `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` (schema `extensions`) and add Testcontainers coverage to verify extension + dimension metadata, then update environment checklist doc with Supabase post-upgrade verification steps.
