## 1. Executive Summary

- **Readiness Score:** **92 %** – architecture is broadly ready; minor follow-ups identified for observability and potential search enhancements.
- **Status:** READY WITH NOTES  
  - ✅ Functional and non-functional requirements are addressed by documented components.  
  - ✅ All four epics align with concrete services, data models, and integration paths (see separate epic alignment matrix).  
  - ⚠️ Two open recommendations: finalize monitoring stack implementation plan (Sentry + Prometheus/Grafana) and validate whether pgvector metadata queries meet pilot recall targets before adding a dedicated search service.

## 2. Requirements Coverage

| Requirement Type | Total | Covered by Architecture | Coverage Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Requirements (FR) | 76 | 76 | Each module (System, COA, AR, AP, Cash/Bank, Tax/E-Invoice, Reporting, Period Mgmt, RAG) maps to documented services and data flows. |
| Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) | 12 | 12 | Performance budgets, availability (ECS + Supabase), security (RBAC, RLS, encryption), compliance (audits, retention), operability (observability) all addressed. |
| Epics | 4 | 4 | Component boundaries and tech choices enable each epic; detailed in epic alignment matrix. |
| Stories | 38 | 36 | Two pilot-dependent stories (advanced search recall tuning, observability dashboards) flagged as pending validation but supported by architecture foundations. |

**Story Readiness:** 36 / 38 stories have clear technical pathways. Remaining 2 relate to productionizing observability dashboards and advanced search fallback; architecture provides hooks but requires future validation work.

## 3. Technology Table Validation

- ✅ Technology and Library Decision Table present with explicit versions for every entry.
- ✅ No vague placeholders or multi-option rows.
- ✅ Decisions include rationale connected to FR/NFR context.

---

## 4. Code vs Design Balance

- ✅ Document remains design-focused: domain descriptions, data models, API routes, deployment plans.  
- ✅ No large implementation code blocks (>10 lines).  
- ✅ Sufficient beginner-oriented explanations per user skill level.

## 5. Vagueness & Over-Specification Review

| Observation | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ambiguous language (“appropriate”, “some”, “TBD”) | ⚠️ Minor | Observability/search follow-ups framed as future validation; maintain explicit action items. |
| Overly prescriptive implementation code | ✅ None | All guidance stays at design/pattern level. |
| Open questions | ⚠️ Two | Monitoring stack rollout sequencing; search fallback decision after pilot recall measurements. |

## 6. Epic Alignment (Summary)

See `docs/epic-alignment-matrix.md` for the full matrix. Highlights:
- Epic 1 covers ingestion, masking, vector management, and streaming APIs with Supabase + n8n pipelines.
- Epic 2 leverages accounting modules plus RAG orchestration to support domain intelligence and compliance gates.
- Epic 3 focuses on UX/performance via React SPA, TanStack Query policies, and SSE streaming.
- Epic 4 formalizes security, audit, and deployment guardrails; penetration testing scheduled pre-release.

## 7. Recommendations

| Priority | Recommendation | Owner | Target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | Lock in monitoring/alert stack (Sentry + Prometheus/Grafana) and document dashboard SLAs before ending Sprint 1. | DevOps lead | Sprint 1 end |
| **Important** | Evaluate pgvector recall using pilot datasets; decide on Elasticsearch/Meilisearch adoption only if recall <0.9. | RAG platform team | Pilot exit criteria |
| **Important** | Produce detailed runbooks for n8n workflow failure handling (retry, escalation). | Operations | Sprint 2 |
| **Nice-to-have** | Prepare ADR for potential service extraction of `rag-platform` if load forecasting warrants. | Architecture | Pre-Phase 2 |

---

## 8. Overall Assessment

- **Readiness Score:** 92 % (Ready with notes)  
- Architecture supports immediate progress into specialist validation and tech-spec generation.  
- Address the noted recommendations during early sprints to keep compliance and performance objectives on track.
