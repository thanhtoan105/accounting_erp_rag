- **2025-10-21**: Completed testarch-automate for Story 1.5. Created comprehensive test plan (docs/TEST-PLAN-STORY-1.5.md) following Test Levels Framework and Test Priorities Matrix. Documented 6 P0 unit tests (RagQueryController, QueryEmbeddingService, VectorSearchService, ContextWindowManager, QueryLoggerService, RagQueryService) and 2 P1 integration tests (RAG Query Pipeline Integration, Vector Search with Real Data). Test execution strategy: Phase 1 (Unit tests), Phase 2 (Integration tests with Testcontainers), Phase 3 (Performance tests deferred to Story 1.10). DoD checklist: 80% coverage target, no flaky tests, execution <5min. Test data requirements documented. Next: Implement tests or proceed with story approval.
- **2025-10-21**: Completed testarch-trace for Story 1.5. Generated comprehensive requirements traceability matrix (docs/qa/assessments/TRACEABILITY-STORY-1.5.md) mapping all 10 acceptance criteria to implemented tests. **Coverage Analysis**: 0 FULL, 5 PARTIAL (AC1, AC6, AC8, AC9, AC10), 5 NONE (AC2, AC3, AC4, AC5, AC7). **Critical Gaps**: 6 P0 unit tests missing (QueryEmbeddingService, VectorSearchService, ContextWindowManager, QueryLoggerService, RagQueryService, Controller rewrite), 2 P1 integration tests missing (Pipeline E2E, Vector Search). **Gate Status: 🔴 BLOCKED** - missing critical test coverage required for production readiness. **Risk**: HIGH without automated validation of core functionality, audit trail compliance, and observability. **Estimated Effort**: 13-19 hours for complete test suite. **Recommendation**: Create missing tests before story approval OR accept technical debt with explicit risk acknowledgment. User decision required: proceed with test implementation, defer tests to follow-up, or approve with gaps documented.
