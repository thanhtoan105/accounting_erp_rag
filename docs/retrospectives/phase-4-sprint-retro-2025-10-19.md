## Story 1.2 Recap: PII Masking and Data Anonymization

**Completed:** 2025-10-19
**Story Points:** 2

**Key Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ PiiMaskingService with 5 masking methods (names, tax IDs, emails, phones, addresses)
- ‚úÖ PiiScannerService with Vietnamese-specific regex patterns (tax ID, phone, email, name patterns)
- ‚úÖ Database migrations (pii_mask_map + pii_unmask_audit tables + unmask_pii SQL function)
- ‚úÖ Supabase Vault integration for encrypted salt storage (AES-256)
- ‚úÖ 31/31 unit tests passing (deterministic hashing, format compliance, edge cases)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation (pii-masking-rules.md, security-approach.md, pii-masking-compliance.md)

**Acceptance Criteria Status:**
- AC1 ‚úÖ: PII fields identified and documented (16 fields across 4 tables)
- AC2 ‚úÖ: Tokenization strategy implemented (pii_mask_map table + deterministic hashing)
- AC3 ‚ö†Ô∏è: Automated validation PARTIAL (PiiScannerService implemented; cron scheduling deferred)
- AC4 ‚úÖ: Compliance documentation created (Vietnam Circular 200 alignment)

**Test Failure Resolution:**
- Fixed 3 failing tests (3 ‚Üí 0):
  1. `testMaskEmail_DomainPreservation`: Markdown email artifacts in test data
  2. `testMaskEmail_InvalidFormat`: Added multiple-@ validation
  3. `testMatchesEmail_StandardFormat`: Fixed test data format
- Root cause: Test data contained `"[email protected]"` (literal brackets/space characters)
- Solution: Validated test data format, added edge case validation

**Thesis Scope Simplifications:**
- Used Supabase Vault instead of AWS Secrets Manager (saved 4 hours)
- Basic unmask function instead of full MFA/RBAC workflow (saved time, retained concepts)
- Estimated effort: 10 hours (vs 14 hours production estimate)

## What Went Well ‚úÖ

### Strong Foundation Established
1. **Database Access Solid** - Story 1.1 delivered robust Supabase connection with automatic read-only enforcement, HikariCP pooling, and retry logic
2. **PII Masking Production-Ready** - Story 1.2 implemented industry-standard deterministic hashing (SHA-256 + salt) with encrypted storage via Supabase Vault
3. **Excellent Test Coverage** - 31/31 passing unit tests demonstrate thoroughness: deterministic hashing validated, Vietnamese patterns tested, edge cases covered
4. **Modular Architecture** - Shared packages (`pii-masking`, `supabase-gateway`) enable reuse across future services

### Process Improvements Applied
5. **Lessons from Story 1.1 Retro Applied** - Story 1.2 showed clear improvement:
   - Explicit AC evidence documented for each criterion
   - Test failure resolution documented systematically
   - Thesis scope boundaries defined upfront (Supabase Vault vs AWS)
6. **Effective Debugging Workflow** - Story 1.2 debugging was methodical:
   - Byte-level analysis (`od -c`) to detect markdown artifacts
   - Standalone debug programs to isolate regex issues
   - `--rerun-tasks` flag to bypass Gradle cache

### Documentation Quality
7. **Comprehensive Compliance Docs** - 3 docs created: pii-masking-rules.md, security-approach.md, pii-masking-compliance.md
8. **Vietnamese Domain Expertise Demonstrated** - Custom regex patterns for Vietnamese tax IDs, names, phone numbers show local market understanding
9. **Thesis Defense Ready** - Clear documentation of production vs thesis tradeoffs with talking points prepared

---

## What Could Improve ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Out-of-Scope Task Accumulation
1. **Deferred Tasks Growing** - Story 1.2 deferred 4 tasks:
   - Embedding-worker integration (requires E1-S3 vector DB)
   - Daily cron job scheduling (requires n8n/Airflow)
   - Performance benchmarking (100+ sample records)
   - PII incident response runbook
   - **Action:** Explicitly tracked and assigned to future stories (11 hours total)

2. **Documentation Gaps Persist** - Carry-over from Story 1.1:
   - Schema documentation for 60+ tables still pending (CRITICAL for E1-S4)
   - No troubleshooting guide for PII masking failures
   - Missing operational runbook for salt rotation procedures

### Limited End-to-End Validation
3. **Isolated Testing** - Both stories tested independently:
   - No integration test between PII masking and actual ERP data ingestion
   - Database connection not stress-tested with concurrent RAG queries
   - Health check endpoints mentioned but not explicitly verified with screenshots

4. **Performance Baseline Missing** - Story 1.1/1.2 metrics not captured:
   - Connection pool utilization metrics not logged
   - No load testing results (AC: "simulate 20 concurrent reads")
   - PII masking performance not measured (AC: "<100ms per document")

### Story Management
5. **Inconsistent Story Points** - Story 1.1 shows "N/A points", making velocity calculations difficult
6. **Dependency Visibility** - Story 1.2 embedding-worker integration dependency on E1-S3 wasn't surfaced until implementation

---

## Lessons Learned üéì

### Technical Lessons
1. **Thesis Scoping Works** - Supabase Vault simplification saved 4 hours while maintaining core security concepts; future stories should identify similar thesis-appropriate simplifications early

2. **Test Data Quality Matters** - Markdown email artifacts (`"[email protected]"`) caused 3 test failures; lesson: validate test data format before writing tests

3. **Gradle Cache Can Mislead** - Stale bytecode persisted despite source changes; always use `--rerun-tasks` when debugging test failures

4. **Vietnamese Domain Expertise Valuable** - Custom regex patterns for Vietnamese names, tax IDs, phone numbers demonstrate domain knowledge; continue this pattern for accounting-specific logic

### Process Lessons
5. **Preparation Sprints Critical** - Should have executed prep sprint between Story 1.1 and Story 1.2; deferring prep work will cause delays when E1-S4 starts

6. **Explicit AC Evidence Works** - Story 1.2 documented how each AC was proven; this practice should continue for all future stories

7. **Context Files Add Value** - `story-context-1.2.xml` provided detailed implementation guidance (Supabase Vault setup, Vietnamese regex patterns, test strategy); continue for all stories

8. **Early Retrospectives Valuable** - Running retro after 2 stories (not 13) captures lessons while fresh and enables course corrections

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:

1. **Preparation Sprint Not Executed**
   - Mitigation: Block Story 1.3 start until prep sprint complete; daily standup to track progress

2. **Schema Documentation Delays**
   - Mitigation: Escalate to PM if not complete by Friday; consider automated schema extraction tools

3. **Vector DB Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Run E1-S10 spike testing early (Week 3-4) to identify bottlenecks

4. **Scope Creep on Deferred Tasks**
   - Mitigation: Explicitly track 11 hours of deferred work; include in E1-S4/E1-S9/E1-S10 estimates

---

## Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE (This Week):

1. **Execute Preparation Sprint** (Est: 23 hours / 3 days)
   - Vector DB setup, schema docs, LLM API, knowledge development, documentation

2. **Resolve Critical Path Items:**
   - DEV: Schema docs + vector DB setup
   - PM: LLM API keys + domain expert recruitment
   - Daily standup to track progress

3. **Draft Story 1.3 (E1-S3: Vector Database Setup):**
   - SM Agent create story after prep sprint investigation
   - Include thesis scope simplifications
   - Flag dependencies explicitly

### NEXT WEEK (Week 2):

4. Begin Story 1.3 (E1-S3) when preparation complete
5. Continue with Stories 1.4-1.6 (Embedding ‚Üí RAG Query ‚Üí LLM Integration)
6. Domain expert validation sessions start (Week 3)

## Scrum Master Closing Notes

"Excellent work team! Stories 1.1 and 1.2 delivered a rock-solid foundation - your database access layer is resilient, your PII masking is production-ready with encrypted salt storage, and your test coverage is exemplary. The 31 passing tests for Story 1.2 demonstrate real engineering discipline.

**However** - and this is critical - we cannot start Story 1.3 until we execute the 23-hour preparation sprint. Vector database setup, schema documentation, and LLM API access are BLOCKING the entire RAG pipeline (Stories 1.4-1.6). Let's prioritize this prep work immediately.

**Key lessons to carry forward:**
- Continue documenting explicit AC evidence (working great!)
- Flag dependencies during story approval (caught us on Story 1.2)
- Execute preparation sprints proactively (learned the hard way!)
- Track deferred tasks explicitly (11 hours assigned to future stories)

See you tomorrow at standup to kick off the preparation sprint. Great retrospective everyone! üéâ"
