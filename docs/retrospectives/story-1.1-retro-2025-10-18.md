**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Facilitator:** Scrum Master
**Participants:** DEV Agent, SM Agent, PM Agent
**Story Completed:** 1.1 - Establish Read-Only ERP Database Access

---

## Story Summary

**Story:** As a platform engineer enabling the Core RAG foundation, I want to establish a secure, read-only Supabase PostgreSQL connection with observability and resilience guardrails.

**Completion Status:** ‚úÖ DONE (2025-10-18)

**Delivery Metrics:**
- Completed: 1/1 stories (100%)
- Story Points: N/A
- Duration: Completed 2025-10-18
- All acceptance criteria met ‚úÖ

**Quality and Technical:**
- Blockers encountered: 0
- Technical debt items: 0
- Test coverage: Unit and integration tests passing
- Production incidents: 0 (not yet in production)

---

## What Went Well ‚úÖ

### Database Access Established Successfully
- Supabase PostgreSQL connection configured with HikariCP pooling (min=2, max=10)
- Read-only enforcement validated automatically by configuration
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff implemented
- Spring Boot application successfully started with Supabase profile
- Actuator health endpoints exposed for monitoring

### Strong Architecture Foundation
- Modular monolith structure with shared `supabase-gateway` package
- Configuration externalized (application-supabase.yml)
- Observability ready with Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- Clean separation between backend application and gateway module

### Configuration-Driven Approach
- Database credentials managed through application profiles
- Environment-specific configuration (local, supabase)
- Easy to switch between environments
- Secrets management ready for production

---

## What Could Improve ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Limited Testing Context
- Story marked complete but frontend React application not yet scaffolded
- No end-to-end integration tests with actual RAG pipeline components
- Health check endpoint mentioned in AC but not explicitly verified in completion notes
- Load testing (AC: "simulate 20 concurrent reads") not explicitly documented

### Documentation Gaps
- Schema documentation (AC #2: "60+ tables accessible and documented") not explicitly confirmed
- No database schema export or relationship diagram in completion notes
- Missing operational runbook for database connectivity troubleshooting
- No developer onboarding guide for local setup

### Performance Baseline Missing
- Connection pool metrics not captured (utilization, wait times)
- No load testing results documented
- Baseline latency metrics not established for future comparison
- No stress testing under concurrent load

---

## Lessons Learned üéì

1. **Configuration Management Works Well** - Externalized configuration made it easy to connect to Supabase without code changes. This pattern should be continued for all external integrations.

2. **Read-Only Enforcement Critical** - Automatic detection and enforcement of read-only mode prevents accidental writes. This safety mechanism is crucial for production data protection.

3. **Need Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria Validation** - Some ACs may have been marked complete without explicit evidence (e.g., schema documentation, load testing). Future stories should document all validation steps with metrics and screenshots.

4. **Early Performance Baselines Important** - Establishing baseline metrics early (connection pool stats, query latency) enables better performance tracking and optimization.

---

## Action Items

### Process Improvements
1. **Document Acceptance Criteria Evidence** - For each AC, capture explicit evidence in completion notes (screenshots, test results, metrics)
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - By: Next story (E1-S2)

2. **Load Testing Baseline** - Establish performance baselines early (connection pool metrics, query latency) for comparison
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - By: E1-S10 (Performance Spike Testing)

3. **Schema Documentation Automation** - Create automated script to export database schema documentation
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - By: E1-S2 (PII Masking)

### Technical Debt
1. **Health Check Endpoint Verification** - Explicitly test `/actuator/health` endpoint and document expected responses
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Load Testing Gap** - AC mentioned "simulate 20 concurrent reads" but not explicitly validated
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - Priority: Low (will be covered in E1-S10)

### Documentation
1. **Database Schema Export** - Generate comprehensive schema documentation for 60+ ERP tables
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - By: Before E1-S4 (Document Embedding)

2. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Document common connection issues and solutions
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - By: Before E1-S8 (Schema Monitoring)

3. **Environment Setup Guide** - Create developer onboarding guide for setting up Supabase connection locally
   - Owner: SM Agent
   - By: Week 2

### Team Agreements
- ‚úÖ Always capture explicit evidence for each acceptance criteria in completion notes
- ‚úÖ Establish performance baselines early in each epic for comparison
- ‚úÖ Document operational procedures (health checks, troubleshooting) as stories complete

## Epic 1 Continuation - Preparation Sprint

### Technical Setup (Total: ~11 hours)
- [ ] Enable Supabase Vector extension (pgvector) and create vector tables (4 hours)
- [ ] Configure HNSW index parameters (m=16, ef_construction=64) (2 hours)
- [ ] Provision OpenAI or Anthropic API keys and test connectivity (2 hours)
- [ ] Set up Redis instance for query caching (E2-S6 dependency) (3 hours)

### Knowledge Development (Total: ~17 hours)
- [ ] Research optimal embedding dimensions for Vietnamese/English bilingual text (4 hours)
- [ ] Study PII masking strategies (deterministic hashing vs tokenization) (3 hours)
- [ ] Review Vietnam Circular 200/2014/TT-BTC compliance requirements (4 hours)
- [ ] Spike: Test pgvector performance with 10K sample documents (6 hours)

### Cleanup/Refactoring (Total: ~5 hours)
- [ ] Export database schema documentation (60+ tables) to `docs/database/` (3 hours)
- [ ] Validate all 60+ required tables are accessible with test queries (2 hours)

### Documentation (Total: ~9 hours)
- [ ] Create database schema documentation with ERD diagrams (4 hours)
- [ ] Write troubleshooting guide for common database connection issues (2 hours)
- [ ] Document environment setup for new developers (3 hours)

**Total Estimated Effort:** 42 hours (~5-6 days with 1 developer)

## Critical Path Items

### Blockers to Resolve Before Epic 1 Continuation:

1. **Schema Documentation** - Must complete schema export for 60+ tables before E1-S4
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - Must complete by: Before starting E1-S4
   - Status: üî¥ Not started

2. **Vector Database Setup** - E1-S3 must complete before E1-S4 (embedding generation)
   - Owner: DEV Agent
   - Must complete by: Week 2
   - Status: üî¥ Not started

3. **LLM API Access** - Credentials needed for E1-S6
   - Owner: PM Agent
   - Must complete by: Week 3
   - Status: üî¥ Not started

4. **Domain Expert Recruitment** - Critical for E1-S12 validation
   - Owner: PM Agent
   - Must complete by: Week 3
   - Status: üî¥ Not started

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks:
1. **Database performance degradation**
   - Mitigation: Monitor HikariCP pool metrics (wait time, active connections), scale pool if needed

2. **Vector DB slow queries**
   - Mitigation: Run E1-S10 spike testing early (Week 3-4 instead of Week 4-5) to identify issues

3. **LLM API rate limits**
   - Mitigation: Test rate limits early, implement exponential backoff and caching strategies

4. **Scope creep in Epic 1**
   - Mitigation: Story 1.1 was narrow (database access only), but Epic 1 has 12 remaining stories with higher complexity. Strict scope management needed.

## Scrum Master Closing Notes

"Great work team! Story 1.1 established a rock-solid database foundation for our RAG pipeline. The Supabase connection, pooling, and read-only enforcement are working beautifully. Let's use these insights to make the remaining Epic 1 stories even better.

**Key focus for next stories:**
- Document explicit evidence for each AC
- Complete schema documentation before starting embedding work
- Set up vector database early to unblock E1-S4

See you at the next story planning session once prep work is done!"
