# AI Frontend Prompt: Sales Invoice Detail & Allocation

**Generated:** 2025-10-16
**Project:** accounting_erp_rag
**Screen:** Sales Invoice Detail & Allocation (Single Page)
**Optimized for:** Vercel v0, Lovable.ai, Cursor AI, and similar AI code generation tools

---

## üéØ What to Build

Generate a responsive single-page layout for the **Sales Invoice Detail & Allocation** experience inside the accounting ERP + RAG assistant platform. The page must surface invoice metadata, approval status, line items, attachments, audit trail, allocation guidance, and contextual AI insights in both Vietnamese and English.

Primary users:
- **Lan (Senior Accountant):** enters and maintains invoices, resolves allocations quickly.
- **Minh (Finance Director):** reviews status and SLA breaches, exports evidence.
- **Auditors:** read-only access to activity timeline and supporting docs.

Key goals:
1. Present authoritative invoice information with multi-currency support and compliance guardrails.
2. Provide allocation workspace with AI-assisted suggestions and escalation cues when approvals stall.
3. Maintain auditability via timeline, citations, and download packages.

## üß© Required Page Regions

1. **Header Band (sticky)**
   - Invoice status chip (color-coded) + SLA countdown and escalation banner when overdue.

2. **Tabbed Workspace (main content)**

   - Each tab retains scroll position; highlight active tab with teal underline.

3. **Summary Tab**
   - `SummaryCard` grid with totals, tax breakdown, payment schedule.
   - `ApprovalBanner` showing approver avatars, due-by timestamps, escalation CTA.
   - `AIInsightCard` presenting assistant recommendation (e.g., ‚ÄúPayment partially matched with Receipt #RC-2045‚Äù) with citations.

4. **Line Items Tab**
   - Ledger-style table (sticky header) with columns: Item, Account, Quantity, Unit Price, Tax %, Amount, Allocation Status.
   - Inline edit rows with keyboard shortcut hints (`Shift+Enter` to save line).
   - Multi-currency badge per row when different from base currency.

5. **Attachments Tab**
   - File cards with preview (PDF, image), description, upload timestamp, and download button.
   - Split view for drag/drop upload (development note: use placeholder logic).

6. **Audit Trail Tab**
   - Vertical timeline with timestamps, actor avatar, action summary, AI narrative overlays.

   - `AllocationSuggestions` list with confidence badges (High/Medium/Low) and `Apply` buttons.

## üîÑ States & Interactions

- **Status Chips:** Pending (amber), Approved (teal), Rejected (critical), Escalated (amber with icon).
- **SLA Countdown:** Timer turns amber when <24h and red when overdue.
- **Inline Editing:** Activate row via `Enter`, confirm `Shift+Enter`, cancel `Esc`. Validation errors show inline with red border + helper text.
- **AI Insight:** Display citation list (document ID, page). Include `View Source` button.
- **Allocation Apply:** Clicking `Apply` animates transfer of suggestion into ledger row; show toast with undo option.
- **Attachment Upload:** Simulate progress bar; support re-ordering.
- **Timeline Filter:** Provide filter chips (Approvals, Edits, AI) with accessible toggles.

---

## üì± Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop ‚â•1280px:** Tabs + sidebar side-by-side (8/4 split). Header fixed. Footer metrics visible.
- **Tablet 768‚Äì1279px:** Sidebar collapses to icon buttons; opens as drawer. Tabs occupy full width.
- **Mobile ‚â§767px:** Header condenses; tabs convert to accordion. Sidebar content becomes slide-over triggered by `Insight & Actions` button. Ensure approve/decline buttons remain accessible.

---

## ‚ôø Accessibility Mandates

- WCAG 2.1 AA targets; 100% keyboard operable.
- Visible focus states (teal outline) on all interactive elements including table rows and timeline items.
- Provide aria-live updates for SLA countdown and AI insight updates.
- All icons require aria-labels; bilingual labels must preserve meaning in VI/EN.
- Reduced-motion preference disables shimmer animations and uses instant fades.
